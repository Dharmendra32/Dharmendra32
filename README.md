ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Mechanical Engineer with over 8 years of experience in the localization industry. My journey has taught me the importance of precision and adaptability, but I'm ready to take my skills to the next level.

ðŸ’¡ Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a keen interest in Data Science and Python programming. Iâ€™m excited to dive into the world of data, uncover insights, and leverage analytics to drive decision-making.

ðŸŒŸ I'm passionate about continuous learning and always looking for new challenges to motivate and enhance my career. Letâ€™s connect and explore the possibilities of merging engineering with data!

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate, share ideas, or chat about tech!
